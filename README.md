Duuuude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Until Dawn and I am SHOOK. Like, seriously, these characters make the dumbest choices, and I was yelling at my screen the whole time. I mean, who hears creepy noises and just goes, “Let’s split up!” Like, come on, that’s horror   101. 

> But okay, here’s the thing: it’s actually kinda good? Like, I was NOT expecting it, but I got totally sucked into the story. And the butterfly effect stuff? Pretty wild. Makes me wonder if choosing the chicken nuggets over a salad at lunch could lead to a life-or-death scenario one day, lol. 

Also, side note: I really thought it was gonna be one of those cheesy horror flicks, but man, was I wrong. I literally had to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for maximum immersion, and lemme tell you, my heart rate has never been the same. Ugh, I’m gonna be listening for demon birds and stuff in my backyard every time I leave the house now.

And can we talk about the effects? Like, it’s a bit much sometimes when the gore levels are off the charts, but also kinda impressive? Okay, but let me not get carried away with how much I lowkey liked it. Overall, I just didn’t expect that twist midway. Is it just me, or do you lowkey start suspecting everyone when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Tactical paranoia lolz.

function randomThought() {
  console.log(Why did I even write this);
}

Anyway, I’m feeling all kinds of jittery now, but like, a good kind? Brain’s a bit scrambled, so forgive the rambling, haha. Maybe I should chill with some mindless sitcoms for the rest of the night or swallow a gallon of sleepy tea or something. We gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something equally wild together soon tho, let’s plan something!
